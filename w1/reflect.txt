I have done all the coding by myself and only copied
the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, our institute provides an approximate 300-line code in C++, and my task is to distribute the code into pieces and save them to the following files. **shoppingListApp.cpp**, **File.cpp**, **ShoppingList.cpp**, **ShoppingRec.cpp**, and **Utils.cpp** & Header files **File.h**, **ShoppingList.h**, **ShoppingRec.h**, and **Utils.h**. In this workshop, code is divided into parts that have memory or are without memory. In header files, the code is without memory, whereas CPP carries code that has memory.
Â 
Other benefits are:
1) organized: code is organized in a good manner.
2) Hide the details: By this technique, unnecessary things are hidden.
3) Speed up the process: By dividing into many parts, the speed of application becomes faster than in the previous one.

In this workshop, the mean thing is that it covers all the components of C programming and gets a good startup in C++. Boolean is also added in this true and false, which was not available in C. It also enhances knowledge about the C++ programming language.The code is about shopping cart, to take input from user and give the output according to it.
